# Very Funny Jokes Machine

> **A next-generation comedy UI trained on actual humor, strictly prohibiting boring dad jokes.**

Welcome to the **Very Funny Jokes Machine**, a sleek, interactive web application that serves up genuinely witty, clever, and slightly sarcastic jokes. Built with a premium glassmorphism design, zero external dependencies, and a smart categorization engine, this app proves that web development doesn't have to be entirely serious.

## Core Features

* **Smart Categorization:** Filter humor by **Programming**, **Tech Life**, **AI & Robots**, **School**, **Absurdity**, or opt for a lightweight **Roast**.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** A modern, frosted-glass aesthetic built entirely with **CSS3 variables and backdrops**.
* **Integrated Dark Mode:** Seamlessly toggle between light and dark themes (because light mode attracts bugs).
* **Web Audio Synthesis:** Generates a playful "pop" sound using the **Web Audio API**—zero external sound files required.
* **Interactive Reactions:** Users can rate jokes using **animated emoji buttons** for instant tactile feedback.
* **One-Click Copy:** Share the laughs instantly with a built-in **clipboard API integration** and toast notifications.

## Technical Stack

| Technology | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Semantic structure, accessible attributes, and Font Awesome icon integration |
| **CSS3** | CSS variables, responsive flexbox layout, custom animations, and state transitions |
| **Vanilla JS** | DOM manipulation, `localStorage` for theme saving, and array filtering |
